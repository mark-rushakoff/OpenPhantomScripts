# This version of .travis.yml always downloads the stable version of
# phantom-qunit.js before running the tests, so you don't have to check
# phantom-xxx.js into your repository.  Make sure to change qunit to jasmine or
# mocha if necessary.  If you aren't sure which version of .travis.yml to use,
# pick this one.

# We aren't actually using any particular language here, so let's use Ruby
# since that's probably the most likely Travis worker to be available
